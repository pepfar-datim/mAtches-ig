  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    mAtches is a tool that improves and facilitates exchange of data using, FHIR standards. Data experts can define data requirements for one or more indicators using FHIR Questionnaires. Non-techinical users can then map their proprietary data using mAtches' intuitive, easy-to-follow UI and generate a FHIR resource (bundle of questionnaire responses) allowing downstream systems consume their data in a consistent and compliant format.
mAtches is part of PEPFAR's Data Aggregation Service for Health (DASH) architecture which is exporing ways to facilitate data exchange and allow for easy aggregation of patient-level data. DASH is a project within PEPFAR's Data Use Community. <br/>
<b>Please note mAtches has been developed as a proof-of-concept project. We are working to productize mAtches to make it more generally accessible and more technically robust.</b>

    The main sections of this IG are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="background.html">Background</a> - provides business context for the implementation guide and information that implementers should be
      familiar with before reading the remainder of the IG.  There could be multiple pages for this.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="spec.html">Detailed Specification</a> - The actual stuff implementers are expected to do.  (Could be multiple pages for this.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="downloads.html">Downloads</a> - Allows downloading a copy of this implementation guide and other useful information
