### Running mAtches locally
A. Fork repo App is configured to run on port 5001, to change this, edit line 10 of the config.json file

B. Update config.json file Change any settings (organization name, appName, FHIR Server) in the config.json file. A summary of configuration options is provided below:

base: If this is "/", mAtches will run at http://localhost:5001/. If this is "/some/other/extension/", mAtches will run at http://localhost:5001/some/other/extension/. Should end in /.
name: This name will appear in the top-left corner and is the name of the organization/instance for instance of mAtches.
appName: This name will appear in the top-left corner. If you use 'mAtches' here, the app will be named mAtches, but you can also rename.
allowExternalURL: This is a boolean value (true/false). This property would allow you to send a bundle of questionnaireResponses to an external URL (note this feature is being deprecated)
externalMappingLocation: This is the name for an external mapping location. It appears in the button which reads "SUBMIT TO {NAME}".
externalMappingLocationURL: This is the URL for an external mapping location (i.e. where the map will be sent when you hit "Submit"). Should end in /. You can use the default here for sandbox testing.
fhirServer: FHIR server where questionnaires are stored. Should end in /. Should end in /. You can use the default here for sandbox testing.
persistencyLocation: Where maps are persisted locally before they are submitted to external location. Should end in /. See notes below for further details on configuring this.
Note on persistency location: the default here is /usr/local/mAtches/data/. Regardless of whether you use this default persistency location, or if you choose to configure another location, you must create a maps subdirectory within this location and initiate an empty maps.json file within that maps subdirectory.

If you are using a Unix machine, the following commands can be used to set up the persistency storage (assuming you already have a /usr/local directory and wish to use the default location). Note that depending on your settings you may need to run some or all of these commands with sudo before the beginning of the command.

mkdir mAtches && cd $_ #create mAtches directory and go there
mkdir data && cd $_ #create data subdirectory and go there
mkdir maps #create maps subdirectory
chmod a+rw maps #give users ability to read/write from files within maps subdirectory
echo "{}" > maps/maps.json #create empty maps.json file
C. Set up and start frontend

Install dependencies npm install

Run app npm start
